# HWLib
This repo host under developing HW components for my research interest. Besides, some components might be delivered to the creator.

## Todo

- [x] interface definition
- [x] we need the implementation of `hard_sigmoid` function
	- [x] test coverage
- [ ] implementation of the `Relu` function
	- [ ] test coverage
- [ ] implementation of the full functional `linear layer`
	- [ ] test coverage


## File structure
```
.
├── README.md
├── source
└── testbench
```
- `source` folder contains all hardware components
- `testbench` folder contains all corresponding tests for each component
